# T'nea's Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my portfolio. This is where I will store all of my projects as I begin my career as a coder. Thanks so much for taking the time to look through!

I have been coding off and on for over 10 years and have found my love for it all over again. I'm 32 years old and I am native to Chattanooga, TN. A fun fact about me is that I played the trombone in High School.
