  <h1>T'nea's Portfolio</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio.
     This is where I will store all of my projects as I
      begin my career as a coder. Thanks so much for taking
      the time to look through!</p>
      <br>

      <p>I have done a bit of coding in the past and have found my love for it all over again.
        I'm 32 years old and I am native to Chattanooga, TN.
        A fun fact about me is that I played the trombone in High School. </p>
